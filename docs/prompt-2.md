You have done an amazing job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in reviewing and validating the given clinic makeover design blueprint! Please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to improve my current blueprint with your valuable suggestions. Then meticulously plan to create an implementation plan to create a complete working replacement version of the improved blueprint/PRD. Your implementation plan should create a comprehensive replacement PRD that is practical and detailed in its codebase description, include a file listing and hierarchy diagram with key files and their descriptions, a mermaid diagram of the application logic flow, a mermaid diagram of the user and modules interactions. Review and validate your implementation plan for the improved blueprint/PRD before proceeding cautiously.
