Awesome job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in first planning before executing! Please keep up the good work!

Yes, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to first meticulously plan how best to create the remaining Phase 0 files as spelled out in your `Master_Execution_Plan`. Then meticulously plan to create each of the following files, include in your plan a checklist for each file. Review and validate the plan for completeness and accuracy and in terms of alignment with your improved PAD and `Master_Execution_Plan`. Then meticulously proceed according to the implementation to create the necessary Phase 0 files.

## Phase 0 – Foundations & Scaffolding

Objective:
Create a clean, minimal Next.js + TypeScript + Mantine + Supabase project with a solid `package.json` and base configs.

Key Decisions:
- Next.js Pages Router (not App Router) for simplicity.
- Use only necessary dependencies (no Prisma, no tRPC for MVP).
- Align versions with your existing environment where they make sense.

### Files & Structure Introduced

- `.env.example`
- `src/pages/_app.tsx`
- `src/pages/index.tsx`
- `src/styles/globals.css`
- Basic `src/lib` folder.
