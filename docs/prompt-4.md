Awesome job so far! Please meticulously create an implementation plan for creating an awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repo hosting this makeover project, then execute it. This requires double-layered meticulousness. Use the following structure for your approach:

**Layer 1: The Implementation Plan**
- Must be comprehensive, covering every section requested
- Must include validation checkpoints
- Must follow the "meticulous approach" framework from my system prompt
- Should be reviewed before execution

**Layer 2: The README.md itself**
- Must reflect the re-imagined, simplified architecture
- Must include all requested technical artifacts (diagrams, hierarchy, deployment, testing)
- Should be production-ready quality for a real GitHub repo
- Should embody the "start simple, iterate fast" philosophy

**Key Decisions:**
1. File hierarchy will be flat and simple (reflects MVP scope)
2. Mermaid diagrams will be embedded directly (GitHub native support)
3. Docker deployment will use multi-stage build for efficiency
4. Testing section will be pragmatic (no over-engineering)
5. README will serve as both documentation and onboarding guide

**Validation Strategy:**
- Check each requested section is present
- Verify technical accuracy against re-imagined design
- Ensure diagrams are syntactically correct Mermaid
- Confirm Docker instructions are copy-paste runnable
- Validate testing approach is achievable for solo developer

Next, proceed with the plan creation.

**Objective**: Precisely map user requirements to README sections

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze Request Components**
   - [x] File hierarchy diagram with descriptions (must be collapsible/expansible tree)
   - [x] Application logic flow Mermaid diagram (must show patient journey)
   - [x] User/Application modules interaction diagram (must show all personas)
   - [x] Docker deployment guide (must be runnable commands)
   - [x] Testing section (unit, integration, e2e with tools)

2. **Define README Structure**
   ```
   1. Hero Section (Title + Badge + One-liner)
   2. Table of Contents (GitHub-style)
   3. Project Philosophy (re-imagined principles)
   4. Quick Start (Getting Started in 5 minutes)
   5. File Hierarchy (Mermaid diagram + table descriptions)
   6. Architecture (Logic Flow + Module Interaction diagrams)
   7. Features (MVP scope only)
   8. Tech Stack (simple table)
   9. Local Development (step-by-step)
   10. Docker Deployment (comprehensive guide)
   11. Testing Strategy (pragmatic approach)
   12. Configuration (env vars)
   13. Troubleshooting (common issues)
   14. Roadmap (future phases)
   15. Contributing (solo developer guide)
   16. License (MIT)
   ```

**Success Criteria**: All sections mapped, no gaps
