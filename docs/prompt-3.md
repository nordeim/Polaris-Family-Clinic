You have done an amazing job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in reviewing and validating the given clinic makeover design blueprint! Please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create an improved `Project Architecture Document` based on your improved PRD and database schema. You will create a comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` that is practical (in applying) and detailed one with a file listing and hierarchy diagram with key files and their descriptions, a mermaid diagram of the application logic flow, a mermaid diagram of the user and modules interactions. And also include key API route skeletons aligned with the database schema you created. 

Then meticulously plan to create an implementation plan to create a complete working replacement version of the improved PAD. Review and validate your implementation plan for the improved PAD before proceeding cautiously.
