Direct answer (with clear recommendation)

Switching wholesale to Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Radix UI is not the right move for this project.

Given:

- The existing architecture and AGENT.md explicitly choose:
  - Next.js (Pages Router) + Mantine + light custom primitives.
- The MVP’s constraints:
  - One clinic, one dev, 4–6 week build, zero DevOps.
- The current state:
  - Landing page HTML structure is already very close to the static trio.
  - Visual issues are now in the last 10–15% polish: typography scale, spacing rhythm, and taming Mantine’s default CSS footprint.

Introducing a second full UI stack (Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix) would:

- Add:
  - New setup + design tokens + component patterns.
  - Extra cognitive load and bundle weight.
- Conflict with:
  - “Deliberately boring” stack choice.
  - Existing Mantine-based flows and components.
- Risk:
  - Inconsistent UX (some screens Mantine-style, others Shadcn/Tailwind-style).
  - Slower iteration, more surface area for bugs.

We can achieve the desired polished, static-mockup-level visual quality with the current stack by tightening our tokens and layout classes (as we’ve begun to do), without architectural churn.

Why it still “looks off” (root causes)

From the latest landing_page.html:

- Pros:
  - Correct sections, IDs, and content.
  - Our ui-card, ui-btn, hero-* classes applied.
- Remaining issues:
  - Mantine base theme still using generic system fonts:
    - :root for Mantine is not using Inter / DM Sans, so headings and layout feel generic.
  - Visual rhythm:
    - Some padding/margins still driven by Mantine’s spacing tokens (e.g., Stack, Grid inline styles), not always aligned with the static mock’s ratios.
  - Inconsistent primitives:
    - We still mix:
      - .ui-btn and .btn in a few places.
      - Some elements styled via Mantine Text/Title defaults + inline vars, rather than fully controlled through our CSS.

All of these are solvable in-place:

- Set Mantine’s theme fonts to match our static design.
- Make our ui-* layer the single source of truth for layout/typography look.
- Eliminate leftover .btn usage and ensure consistent classes.

High-precision plan (without switching stacks)

If the goal is: “Next iteration must visually match the static mockup,” the plan is:

1) Align global typography and base styles

- Configure MantineProvider (in src/pages/_app.tsx) to use:
  - fontFamily: 'Inter', system-ui, ...
  - headings.fontFamily: 'DM Sans', system-ui, ...
- Ensure:
  - body background, text color, and line-height match static via global CSS (already partially done; confirm).
- Outcome:
  - All Mantine components use the correct fonts and baseline, removing the generic look.

2) Normalize CTAs and links

- Ensure:
  - All primary CTAs use UiButton (ui-btn variants), not raw .btn from the static HTML.
  - Any remaining .btn btn-primary btn-large in JSX should be replaced with UiButton or styled anchor with ui-btn classes.
- This makes:
  - CTA visual language consistent and polished.

3) Tighten hero spacing and layout

- Use our CSS (already appended in tokens.css) to:
  - Set max-width for hero content.
  - Define a consistent vertical rhythm:
    - Eyebrow → H1 → subtitle → CTAs → trust row.
- Minor tweaks:
  - Slightly larger H1 and more distinct weight for headings (via Mantine theme + our CSS).
  - Ensure hero card and mini-card are visually balanced (padding, gap, shadow).

4) Grid & sections polish

- Confirm:
  - grid-three uses equal-width cards with uniform padding and shadows (already mostly there).
  - seniors-grid and staff-grid:
    - Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.
- Adjust:
  - Section paddings top/bottom to match static (we’ve set var(--space-section-y); refine if needed).

5) Nav / header polish

- PublicHeader already:
  - Sticky, blurred, with brand mark.
- Make sure:
  - nav-links styling (font-size, hover state) matches static.
  - Mobile:
    - .nav-links + .is-open work visually:
      - Right padding, border, background consistent.

6) Cleanup any residual Mantine “noise”

- Mantine’s inline styles (Grid/Stack) are fine; they drive layout only.
- The visual “feel” is now governed primarily by:
  - font families,
  - ui-btn,
  - ui-card,
  - hero-*, sections, grids.
- If any part looks off in the browser:
  - Adjust our CSS variables (margins, font-sizes) rather than swapping stacks.

Conclusion: Should we switch to Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix?

Short, direct answer:

- No.

Rationale:

- We are already very close to the target visual outcome using:
  - Mantine (for layout utilities) + our custom CSS tokens + primitives.
- Swapping to Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix:
  - Increases complexity and violates the project’s “boring, minimal, one-dev” philosophy.
  - Solves a non-problem: our remaining issues are tuning, not capability gaps.
- A disciplined final pass on:
  - Mantine theme config,
  - tokens.css for typography/spacing,
  - and eliminating inconsistent class usage
  will deliver a polished, static-mockup-level result within the existing, well-aligned architecture.

This is the final stance for this iteration: stay on the current stack, finish the polish via targeted CSS and theme alignment, and avoid introducing a new UI stack that conflicts with the project’s constraints and operating manual.
