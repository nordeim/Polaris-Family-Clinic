I’ve implemented the first key adjustment: UiButton is now semantically correct for links and visually driven by our token classes, which is foundational to making the landing page look closer to the static mockup.

Changes implemented

1) UiButton: link-aware, token-driven, less Mantine noise

File:
- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](src/components/ui/button.tsx:1)

What changed:

- Previously:
  - UiButton was a thin wrapper over Mantine Button, not aware of href, and relied heavily on Mantine defaults.
  - This resulted in:
    - Buttons with awkward semantics when used for navigation.
    - Visuals that did not fully match the static pill-style CTAs.

- Now:

  - Extended props:
    - UiButtonProps:
      - Extends Mantine ButtonProps.
      - Adds:
        - href?: LinkProps['href']
        - variant?: 'primary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'subtle'
        - size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
        - fullWidth?: boolean
        - children: ReactNode

  - Class composition:
    - Always applies base .ui-btn.
    - Adds:
      - .ui-btn--primary / --outline / --ghost / --subtle
      - .ui-btn--sm / --md / --lg
      - .ui-btn--full for full-width
    - These are defined in src/styles/tokens.css and control:
      - Pill shape
      - Spacing
      - Color
      - Shadow

  - Link semantics:
    - If href is provided:
      - Wraps in Next.js <Link> with legacyBehavior + passHref.
      - Renders Mantine Button with:
        - component="a"
        - className={ui-btn*}
        - variant="subtle"
        - radius="xl"
      - This yields:
        - Correct anchor semantics for navigation.
        - Visual styling controlled mostly by our CSS tokens.

    - If href is not provided:
      - Renders a regular Mantine Button:
        - className={ui-btn*}
        - variant="subtle"
        - radius="xl"

  - Rationale:
    - Uses Mantine mainly for structure, but delegates shape/color/hover to ui-btn* CSS.
    - Ensures consistent pill-shaped CTAs like in the static mockup.
    - Fixes invalid href-on-button patterns seen in the generated HTML.

Impact on landing page look

With UiButton fixed:

- CTAs on / now:
  - Use proper anchor semantics.
  - Are styled via unified ui-btn tokens for consistent appearance.
  - Are easier to fine-tune globally from tokens.css to match static/index.html.

This directly addresses:
- “Add support for rendering as Next.js Link-friendly anchors”
- “Reduce Mantine visual noise and rely on ui-btn* CSS”
- “Ensure consistent pill shape and spacing”

Planned and recommended next edits (not yet applied in this step, but clearly defined):

To fully close the gap between current dynamic page and the static mockup, apply:

1) UiCard & Section refinements:
   - In src/styles/tokens.css:
     - For .ui-card, adjust:
       - padding to be slightly larger vertically.
       - border-radius to match mockup (already at var(--radius-lg)).
       - use var(--shadow-soft) / var(--shadow-elevated) more consistently.
     - For .ui-section:
       - Ensure vertical padding (var(--space-section-y)) matches mockup sections.
       - ui-section--default: subtle page-bg.
       - ui-section--alt: white surface and clear separation.
       - ui-section--cta: strong gradient with ample padding.

2) Index layout tightening:
   - Slightly reduce hero paragraph sizes (Text size="sm" or custom) to avoid “heavy” Mantine defaults.
   - Ensure the right-hand “Today” card uses a bit less vertical content so it complements, not dominates, the hero.
   - Confirm list-check styling (already present) yields clean bullets consistent with static.

3) Config warnings (later phase):
   - next.config.js:
     - Set i18n.localeDetection = false (boolean) or remove it.
   - static/ usage:
     - Treat as design-only; when ready, move any production assets into /public.
   - output: standalone:
     - Use node .next/standalone/server.js in deployment or adjust config.

Conclusion

- UiButton is now implemented according to the refined design and semantic requirements, which is a core dependency for making the landing page visually match the static mockup.
- All previous builds pass; this change is focused and safe.
- The next step is to:
  - Tune tokens for cards/sections.
  - Make minor index.tsx adjustments to compress hero and balance the layout.
  - Then re-check the rendered HTML/screenshot to confirm close parity with static/index.html while maintaining our architectural and UX constraints.
