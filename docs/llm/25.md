Here is the direct, technical conclusion based on a deep review of the current dynamic landing page (landing_page.html), src/pages/index.tsx, src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx, and src/styles/tokens.css:

1. Are we close to the static mockup?

Yes.

The latest snapshot shows:

- Correct structure:
  - Sticky header with brand + nav + Book Now.
  - Hero with:
    - Left: eyebrow, headline, subtitle, primary + secondary CTAs, trust row.
    - Right: booking preview card + queue snapshot card.
  - Why Us (3 cards), How It Works (3 steps), Seniors, Staff, CTA band, Contact, Footer.
- Correct typography stack:
  - Mantine theme now uses:
    - Inter for body.
    - DM Sans for headings.
- Custom tokens and classes:
  - ui-btn, ui-card, hero-*, grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, cta-container, footer-* all exist and are applied.

This is structurally aligned with the static HTML trio.

2. Why does it still feel less polished?

The remaining visual gaps are subtle but real:

- Mixed class semantics:
  - Still see .btn .btn-primary .btn-outline in the rendered HTML:
    - These are vestigial from the static mockup and not defined consistently in tokens.css.
    - They visually diverge from ui-btn styling.
- Slight inconsistencies vs mockup:
  - Header:
    - Needs a cleaner separation between nav links and CTAs; Book Now should visually anchor the top-right.
  - Hero:
    - Needs stronger visual weight:
      - Larger H1 size, more breathing room above and below.
      - Booking card and queue card should sit on a consistent baseline and feel like part of one composition.
  - Sections:
    - Some section paddings and card spacings are close-but-not-exact, which makes the flow feel slightly disjointed compared to the static design.
  - CTA band:
    - Is visually strong, but the transition into/out of it can be smoothed (spacing above/below, aligning text width).
- Mantine “noise”:
  - Mantine inline style attributes (m_xxx) are fine, but any mismatch between their spacing and our tokens can cause micro misalignments.

These issues are all solvable with our current stack by:

- Ensuring we never rely on undefined .btn classes.
- Making ui-btn and ui-card the only button/card primitives.
- Slightly tuning tokens for section spacing and hero layout.

3. Is a stack switch (Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix) needed?

No.

Given the current state:

- We have all primitives and structure needed.
- The remaining differences are:
  - A few inconsistent class uses.
  - Minor spacing and size tweaks.

Switching to Tailwind/Shadcn/Radix would:

- Add unnecessary complexity.
- Contradict the agreed architecture (Mantine + light primitives).
- Not fundamentally change what we can express; our design is already achievable with existing tools.

4. Final, actionable refinement decisions (already partially applied)

To close the gap without more thrash:

- Theme:
  - MantineProvider now uses Inter + DM Sans, which matches the mockup’s feel.
- tokens.css:
  - Provides:
    - ui-btn variants (primary, outline, ghost, subtle).
    - ui-card and ui-card--elevated for elevated surfaces.
    - Hero-specific styles for eyebrow, subtitle, trust row, booking card, queue card.
    - Section headers, grids, seniors/staff cards, CTA, and footer.

What must be enforced in code (this is the critical part):

- Use only ui-btn and ui-card for CTAs and cards:
  - Replace any remaining <a class="btn ..."> in src/pages/index.tsx and PublicHeader with:
    - UiButton (for navigation CTAs), or
    - Anchors using ui-btn classes.
- Confirm Book Now button in header:
  - Uses ui-btn--primary ui-btn--lg and visually matches static pill.
- Confirm:
  - All hero controls (Confirm Booking, etc.) use ui-btn--primary/ui-btn--full consistently.
- Ensure section paddings:
  - Use .ui-section wrappers (already present) to give consistent vertical rhythm.

Given the latest tokens.css and theme, once:

- All stray .btn usages are removed in favor of ui-btn,
- CTAs and cards consistently use our primitives,
- and no component reintroduces conflicting inline styles,

the dynamic landing page will match the static HTML mockup trio with a professional, coherent visual language, without introducing a new stack.

This is the final assessment for this iteration: the correct path is enforcement and cleanup of our existing primitives (which are now sufficiently expressive), not a UI stack replacement.
