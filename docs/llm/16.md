I’ve addressed the immediate TypeScript build error and validated the underlying cause, and the landing page implementation remains aligned with the static mockup.

1) Build error analysis

Error reported:

- File: [src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx](src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx:1)
- Message:
  - 'Link' is declared but its value is never read.

Root cause:

- PublicHeader previously imported Link from next/link:
  - import Link from 'next/link';
- The final implementation of PublicHeader does not actually use Link:
  - All nav items and CTA buttons are plain anchors (<a href="...">) or UiButton with href.

This unused import violates the TypeScript/ESLint rules enforced by Next.js during build, causing:

- Linting and checking validity of types ..Failed to compile.

2) Fix implemented

Change:

- In [src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx](src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx:1):

Removed unused import:

- Before:
  - import { useState } from 'react';
  - import Link from 'next/link';
  - import { Container, Group } from '@mantine/core';
  - import { UiButton } from '@/components/ui/button';

- After:
  - import { useState } from 'react';
  - import { Container, Group } from '@mantine/core';
  - import { UiButton } from '@/components/ui/button';

Impact:

- Eliminates the unused import; TypeScript/ESLint error is resolved.
- No behavior change to PublicHeader:
  - It still:
    - Renders brand, nav links, Book Now CTA.
    - Implements mobile menu toggle with React state.
    - Uses UiButton for real app route CTAs on large screens.
    - Uses anchor-based in-page links (#hero, #why, #how, #seniors, #book, #contact) consistent with the static mockup and static/js/landing.js behavior.

3) Next build expectations

With this fix:

- The specific TypeScript compile failure is removed.
- Remaining warnings to plan for (not blockers to visuals, but queued for cleanup):
  - next.config.js: i18n.localeDetection invalid literal (should be boolean false or key removed).
  - static directory deprecation: static/ is design-only; for production assets use /public.
  - output: standalone message: adjust production start command as per Next.js docs when deploying.

4) Landing page implementation status

Key confirmation:

- [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:1) now:
  - Uses PublicHeader.
  - Defines sections with IDs and content:
    - #hero, #why, #how, #seniors, staff section, #book, #contact.
  - Mirrors the structure and copy from static/index.html.
  - Uses:
    - UiButton, UiCard, UiBadge, Section, and layout classes defined in tokens.css to closely match static/styles/globals.css.
- The major structural and styling misalignments with the static mockup have been corrected in code, and the remaining differences should now be only minor tuning, not architectural issues.

This completes the requested step: meticulous review and fix of the latest build error, preserving the refined landing page implementation.
