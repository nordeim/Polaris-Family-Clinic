I’ve resolved the latest build blocker and the landing page implementation remains intact.

Issue reviewed

Latest error:

- File: src/pages/index.tsx
- Message:
  - 'Group' is declared but its value is never read.
- Triggered during:
  - “Linting and checking validity of types” in next build.

Root cause:

- After refactoring index.tsx to use:
  - PublicHeader for header/nav.
  - Section, Container, Grid, UiCard, UiButton, etc., for layout.
- The Mantine Group component was no longer used anywhere in index.tsx, but it was still imported:

  - import { Container, Stack, Group, Title, Text, Grid, Divider } from '@mantine/core';

- Unused imports are treated as lint/type errors by Next.js with the current configuration.

Fix applied

Change in:

- [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:2)

Before:

- Container,
- Stack,
- Group,
- Title,
- Text,
- Grid,
- Divider

After:

- Container,
- Stack,
- Title,
- Text,
- Grid,
- Divider

Effect:

- Group is removed from the import list.
- No runtime or visual behavior change, since Group was not used.
- Eliminates the unused symbol, satisfying TypeScript/ESLint and unblocking the build at this point.

Context and consistency check

- Previous similar fixes:
  - Removed unused Link import from:
    - [src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx](src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx:1)
    - [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:1)
- Landing page structure remains:

  - <PublicHeader />
  - Sections with IDs:
    - #hero: Hero with hero grid, booking preview, queue snapshot.
    - #why: Why Gabriel Family Clinic (3 feature cards).
    - #how: How it works (3 steps).
    - #seniors: Seniors & families section with testimonial card.
    - Staff section: For clinic team.
    - #book: CTA band with actions.
    - #contact: Contact grid and footer.

- Styling:
  - Controlled via:
    - [src/styles/tokens.css](src/styles/tokens.css:1) ui-* primitives.
    - Classnames aligned to static mockup (hero-*, grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, cta-container, contact-grid, etc.).
  - UiButton:
    - Proper link semantics (Next Link + <a>) for href.
    - Visuals driven by .ui-btn*, not Mantine defaults.

Next steps (already planned, not yet executed here):

- Address non-fatal warnings in a focused config pass:
  - next.config.js:
    - Fix i18n.localeDetection: set to false or remove invalid value.
  - static directory:
    - Confirm static/ is used only for design reference; ensure production assets reside in /public.
  - output: standalone:
    - Align start command with Next.js guidance for production.

Conclusion

- The immediate build error caused by an unused Group import in src/pages/index.tsx is fixed.
- The landing page remains structurally and visually aligned with the static mockup, with semantics and architecture preserved.
- The project is now ready to re-run npm run build to verify that only configuration warnings remain.
