I have completed the requested Phase 0/1 database foundation work for this repo.

Implemented artifacts:

1) Canonical schema wiring for Supabase

- Confirmed:
  - [database_schema.sql](database_schema.sql:1) is the authoritative schema:
    - Defines `patient_profiles`, `staff_profiles`, `doctors`, `clinic_settings`, `appointments`, `notifications`, `schema_migrations`.
    - Enables RLS and specifies policies consistent with the PAD/PRD.
- Confirmed:
  - [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql:1) is a thin mirror:
    - Uses `\i ../database_schema.sql` so `supabase db push` applies the canonical schema directly.
- This establishes a single, stable source-of-truth for the data model used by all future code.

2) Database admin + seed guide

Created:
- [docs/database_admin_and_seed_guide.md](docs/database_admin_and_seed_guide.md:1)

Content summary (purpose-built for humans and AI agents):

- Explains which files are canonical:
  - `database_schema.sql` for schema and RLS.
  - `supabase/schema.sql` for Supabase CLI.
- Provides two supported ways to apply schema:
  - Supabase SQL Editor.
  - Supabase CLI (`supabase db push`).
- Details required environment variables:
  - Supabase keys, `NRIC_HASH_SECRET`, Twilio vars, `CRON_SECRET`.
- Defines safe seeding procedures:
  - Ensure a single `clinic_settings` row.
  - Create at least one admin staff user:
    - Add a Supabase Auth user.
    - Insert matching `staff_profiles` row with `role='admin'`.
  - Seed `doctors`:
    - At least one `is_active` doctor, optionally linked to staff.
  - Optionally seed a test `patient_profile` for development.
- Outlines how to add an optional seed script later (using service role) without exposing secrets.
- Documents operational safety rules:
  - Always treat `database_schema.sql` as canonical.
  - Keep RLS intact; never weaken without updating docs and code.
  - Twilio/notifications must be best-effort, never blocking bookings.
  - How to handle manual fixes without violating schema/RLS assumptions.
- Provides a concise “from zero to usable backend” checklist:
  - Apply schema → configure env → seed settings/staff/doctors → run app.

Effect on overall plan:

- Phase 0/1 database foundation is now in place:
  - Canonical schema and Supabase mirror confirmed.
  - Clear, repeatable instructions exist for applying schema and seeding minimal data.
  - This forms a stable base for implementing Phase 2 (core patient flows), Phase 3 (staff console + queue), Phase 4 (notifications), and the test suite.

This completes the requested step: establishing the canonical data model with proper migrations wiring (via schema mirror), seed strategy, and an admin guide for future agents and maintainers.
