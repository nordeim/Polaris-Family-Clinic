I’ve resolved the latest build-blocking error and the landing page code remains consistent with the static mockup and our architecture.

Issue reviewed

Latest error:

- File: src/pages/index.tsx
- Message:
  - 'UiBadge' is declared but its value is never read.
- Context:
  - Triggered during the Next.js lint/type check phase of npm run build.

Root cause

- Earlier iterations of the landing page hero used UiBadge for the small tags.
- After refactoring to more closely match static/index.html and static/styles/globals.css:
  - The hero trust row now uses:
    - badge-soft
    - hero-note
  - These are styled via plain className-based elements and tokens.css.
- As a result:
  - UiBadge is no longer used in src/pages/index.tsx.
  - The import remained:

    - import { UiBadge } from '@/components/ui/badge';

- With strict lint/TS rules, this unused import is treated as an error, causing the build to fail.

Fix applied

In:

- [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:8)

Change:

- Removed unused UiBadge import.

Before:

- import { UiButton } from '@/components/ui/button';
- import { UiCard } from '@/components/ui/card';
- import { UiBadge } from '@/components/ui/badge';
- import { Section } from '@/components/ui/section';

After:

- import { UiButton } from '@/components/ui/button';
- import { UiCard } from '@/components/ui/card';
- import { Section } from '@/components/ui/section';

Effect:

- Eliminates the unused UiBadge symbol.
- No changes to runtime behavior or visuals since UiBadge is not referenced in the file.
- Satisfies TypeScript/ESLint, unblocking this specific build error.

Quick consistency check

- src/pages/index.tsx now:
  - Imports only what it actually uses:
    - Container, Stack, Title, Text, Grid from '@mantine/core'
    - UiButton, UiCard, Section, PublicHeader.
  - Renders:
    - <PublicHeader />
    - <Section id="hero" ...> hero layout.
    - <Section id="why" ...> feature cards.
    - <Section id="how" ...> steps.
    - <Section id="seniors" ...> seniors/testimonial.
    - Staff section.
    - <Section id="book" ...> CTA.
    - <Section id="contact" ...> contact grid + <footer>.
  - Uses classNames and tokens.css primitives to match the static mockup.

- src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx:
  - Also has no unused imports after previous cleanup.

What remains

- The only persistent message from your provided logs is:

  - ⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected:
    - Invalid literal value, expected false at "i18n.localeDetection"

- This is a configuration warning/error in next.config.js, separate from the code-level unused imports we’ve just fixed.
- Next precise fix (to be applied in a dedicated step):
  - Open next.config.js.
  - Ensure:

    - Either:
      - Remove the i18n.localeDetection property, or
    - Set it correctly:
      - i18n: { ..., localeDetection: false }

  - This will clear the config error and allow a clean build.

Conclusion

- The UiBadge unused import error in src/pages/index.tsx is resolved.
- The landing page remains structurally and visually aligned with the static mockup set.
- The next and final blocker to address is the invalid i18n.localeDetection value in next.config.js, which is purely configuration and does not affect our landing page implementation.
