I have applied the first targeted fix for the failing build by correcting the Dayjs usage in src/lib/slots.ts.

Change summary

Issue:
- Next build failed with:
  - "Property 'clone' does not exist on type '{ start: Dayjs; end: Dayjs; }'."
- Root cause:
  - I incorrectly called `.clone()` directly on the window objects instead of on their Dayjs properties.

Fix applied:
- File: src/lib/slots.ts

Incorrect code:
- Used:
  - windows[0].clone().startOf('day')...
  - windows[windows.length - 1].clone().endOf('day')...

Corrected code:
- Now uses the stored Dayjs instances directly:

- startOfDayUtc:
  - Derived from windows[0].start

- endOfDayUtc:
  - Derived from windows[windows.length - 1].end

This aligns the implementation with TypeScript’s understanding of the window object shape and removes the incorrect `.clone()` usage, unblocking the prior compilation error.

Important note

- This was a minimal, surgical fix to address the specific build failure you reported.
- Additional type/lint issues (if any) will surface on the next npm run build / lint / type-check.
- In the next phase, I will:
  - Re-run type-check/build (based on your feedback),
  - Systematically address any remaining errors or typing issues across:
    - src/lib/slots.ts (e.g., explicit typings for appointment rows),
    - src/lib/queue.ts (type narrowing),
    - UI primitives (ensure they extend Mantine/React props cleanly, no missing clsx dependency),
    - next.config.js (fix i18n.localeDetection warning),
  - Ensuring the codebase reaches a clean, production-ready state.
