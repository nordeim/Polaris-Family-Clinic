Awesome job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in first planning before executing! Please keep up the good work!

Yes, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to first meticulously plan how best to create a static mockup landing page HTML that matches and aligns with your improved design in your PRD and PAD. Create an awesome static HTML main landing page that can proudly showcase the best in UI/UX design tastes and showcase the best in aesthetics appearance and usability. Use Google Fonts and Shadcn-UI components plus the `src/styles/globals.css` you created in your mockup landing page HTML. Try to create a separate javascript to make the HTML faster to load and more adaptable. Then meticulously plan to create each of the files needed, include in your plan a checklist for each file. Review and validate the plan for completeness and accuracy and in terms of alignment with your improved PAD and `Master_Execution_Plan`. Then meticulously proceed according to the implementation to create all the necessary files for the static HTML landing page mockup.
