I’ve fixed the latest reported build error and kept the landing page implementation intact.

Issue reviewed

Error:

- File: src/pages/index.tsx
- Message:
  - 'Divider' is declared but its value is never read.
- This is surfaced during:
  - “Linting and checking validity of types” in next build.

Root cause:

- Earlier versions of the hero card used Mantine’s Divider.
- After refactoring the hero card to use pure CSS + UiCard (aligned with static mockup), all Divider usages were removed.
- The import list still contained Divider:

  - import { Container, Stack, Title, Text, Grid, Divider } from '@mantine/core';

- With no remaining Divider usage, this became an unused import, which Next.js (with strict TS/ESLint) treats as an error.

Fix applied

Change in:

- [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:1)

Before:

- Container,
- Stack,
- Title,
- Text,
- Grid,
- Divider

After:

- Container,
- Stack,
- Title,
- Text,
- Grid

Effect:

- Removes the unused Divider import.
- No change to runtime behavior or layout (Divider was not used).
- Satisfies TypeScript/ESLint, unblocking this specific build failure.

Current state

- Unused imports that previously broke the build are now removed from:
  - [src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx](src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx:1) (Link)
  - [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:1) (Link, Group, Divider)
- Landing page:
  - Uses PublicHeader and the full set of sections (#hero, #why, #how, #seniors, staff, #book, #contact) mirroring the static mockup.
  - Styling is driven by tokens.css and dedicated classNames, minimizing Mantine’s stylistic interference.
- Remaining console output:
  - Only the configuration warning about i18n.localeDetection in next.config.js should remain; that is a separate configuration task and not a TypeScript/code-level error.

Summary

- The latest build-blocking error (unused Divider import) has been resolved surgically.
- The landing page structure and visuals remain aligned with the static design.
- The codebase is cleaner and should now proceed further in next build, aside from the known next.config.js warning which will be addressed in a dedicated configuration pass.
