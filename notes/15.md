Diagnosis

The latest landing_page.html is much closer structurally but still diverges visually from the static mockup set:

- static/index.html
- static/styles/globals.css
- static/js/landing.js

Key observations:

1) Structure:
- Dynamic page now has:
  - Hero with left content and right booking/queue preview.
  - “Why this system” section.
  - “How it works” section.
  - Seniors/one-clinic section.
  - CTA band.
  - Footer.
- However, it does not include:
  - The sticky header with brand mark and full-nav (Home / Why Us / How / Seniors / Contact / Book Now).
  - The rich feature cards, testimonial card, staff portal preview card, and detailed footer sections from static/index.html.
- Result: Layout feels flatter / less intentional than the static design.

2) Styling:
- tokens.css gives us:
  - ui-section, ui-card, ui-btn, ui-badge, list-check, etc.
- But:
  - The static mockup’s look heavily depends on:
    - .site-header, .nav-links, .hero-grid, .card-elevated, .section-header, .grid-three, .steps-grid, .seniors-grid, .staff-grid, .cta-section, .contact-grid, etc.
  - We haven’t mapped these concepts cleanly into the React/Mantine composition.
  - Some Mantine Text/Title defaults (sizes, margins) are still visible and don’t match the static type scale.

3) Behavior (static/js/landing.js):
- Provides:
  - Mobile nav toggle (data-nav-toggle, data-nav-menu, .is-open)
  - Smooth scroll for data-scroll-to and hash links.
- In the Next.js/Mantine version:
  - We haven’t implemented equivalents.
  - So header feels dead/static vs the mockup’s responsive nav.

Conclusion:
- The mismatch is not due to missing JavaScript alone.
- It is due to only partially porting the design system:
  - We borrowed some pieces (ui-btn, ui-card, ui-section) but not the full layout/nav/section hierarchy from static/index.html and static/styles/globals.css.

Strategic correction (clear next steps)

To fully align the dynamic landing page with the static mockup while respecting the Next.js + Mantine + tokens architecture, we must:

1) Introduce a dedicated top-level header component that matches the static nav:

- New file: src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx
  - Uses:
    - UiButton for “Book Now” CTA.
    - Next.js Link for scroll targets or routes.
  - Structure:
    - Brand mark “G” + clinic name + subtitle.
    - Horizontal nav (Home, Why Us, How It Works, For Seniors, Contact, Book).
    - Mobile nav toggle and is-open state (mirroring static/js/landing.js) implemented with React useState.
  - Behavior:
    - For this MVP, anchor links (#hero/#why/#how/#seniors/#book/#contact) can be smooth-scrolled using:
      - Native browser behavior for now, or a tiny useEffect-based scroll helper if needed.
- HomePage will render:
  - <PublicHeader />
  - <main>…sections…</main>
- This brings:
  - The same visual and interaction affordances as the static nav.
  - No backend impact.

2) Reshape src/pages/index.tsx sections to map 1:1 to static sections:

- Hero:
  - Match:
    - .hero-grid behavior:
      - Left: eyebrow, H1, subtitle, hero-actions, hero-trust.
      - Right: hero-card (booking preview), hero-mini-card (queue snapshot).
  - Use:
    - Mantine Grid but anchored to classes in tokens.css for hero layout, not generic spacing.
  - Concretely:
    - Add classNames where needed:
      - className="hero-grid" on Grid container.
      - className="hero-card", "hero-mini-card" on UiCard.
      - className="eyebrow", "hero-subtitle", "hero-trust", "badge-soft", etc., mapped from static CSS.

- Why Us:
  - Implement:
    - Section header -> Title + Text.
    - grid-three of feature cards with icons (🧓, ⏱️, 🔒) as in static/index.html.
  - Use:
    - UiCard for card-elevated.
    - A simple Grid or divs with className="grid-three".

- How It Works:
  - Already close.
  - Ensure:
    - step-number styling matches static CSS (we already have .step-number in tokens).

- Seniors & Staff:
  - Implement:
    - seniors-grid and staff-grid layouts:
      - Left column lists, right column testimonial/staff preview card.
  - Use:
    - UiCard for the testimonial and staff portal preview.

- CTA:
  - Use:
    - Section variant="cta"
    - Structure similar to cta-section and cta-actions.

- Contact/Footer:
  - Mirror:
    - contact-grid and site-footer structure from static.

3) Respect static/styles/globals.css naming where feasible:

- Many of the mockup’s aesthetics come from specific classnames and grid structures.
- Our tokens.css already contains many analogs; where missing, we either:
  - Add minimal CSS for hero-grid, grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, contact-grid.
  - Or map Mantine components to existing classnames.
- This is purely presentational and safe for MVP.

4) Behavioral enhancements (lightweight, optional):

- Implement smooth scroll using:
  - A small client-side handler attached to nav links.
- Implement mobile nav toggle:
  - Mirror static/js/landing.js semantics:
    - data-nav-toggle, data-nav-menu, is-open class.
  - Or use React state inside PublicHeader.

This will:

- Make the dynamic page feel cohesive and intentionally designed.
- Make it visually near-identical to static/index.html when viewed in the browser.
- Keep us compliant with the architecture (no arbitrary script tags; use React/Mantine, CSS modules/tokens).

Current step outcome

In this step:

- Confirmed via landing_page.html that:
  - UiButton anchor rendering is now correct.
  - Core token styles and structures are in place.
- Identified the remaining delta precisely:
  - Missing top-level nav header.
  - Missing feature/testimonial/staff/footer sections in their full richness.
  - Incomplete mapping of static CSS layout classes to Next.js components.

Next implementation step (following this plan):

- Add PublicHeader component and wire into HomePage.
- Expand index.tsx sections to fully mirror static/index.html semantics and class mappings.
- Add minimal supporting CSS (either extending tokens.css or a dedicated landing.css) to support hero-grid, grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, cta-container, and contact-grid.
- Keep changes strictly cosmetic/structural; no breaking of backend logic or routes.

This is the corrected, explicit plan to take the dynamic landing page from “almost” to a faithful, production-quality implementation of the provided static mockup set.
