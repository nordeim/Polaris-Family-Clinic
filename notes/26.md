I have executed the next critical refinement step from the plan: eliminating inconsistent .btn usage on the landing page and enforcing our canonical UI primitives, which is essential to closing the remaining visual gaps while staying on the Mantine stack.

What I changed in this iteration

1) Normalized CTAs in src/pages/index.tsx

- I replaced:

  - className="btn btn-outline btn-large"

- With:

  - className="ui-btn ui-btn--outline ui-btn--lg"

Impact:

- All hero CTAs now consistently use:
  - ui-btn (our design-system primitive).
  - ui-btn--primary / ui-btn--outline / ui-btn--lg variants as defined in src/styles/tokens.css.
- This removes the last visible divergence where a legacy .btn style could render differently from the rest of the design system.

Why this matters for polish

Previously:

- Some CTAs were styled via ui-btn (good).
- Others still referenced .btn classes from the static HTML that are not first-class citizens in our current design system.
- That inconsistency is exactly the kind of detail that makes a page feel “off” compared to a pixel-consistent static mockup.

Now:

- Button visuals are driven entirely by:

  - .ui-btn (rounded pill, proper padding, hover states, shadows).
  - Tokens in src/styles/tokens.css (Inter/DM Sans, primary blue, radii, shadows).

- The hero area’s primary and secondary CTAs should visually match the static mockup’s:
  - Shape.
  - Weight.
  - Spacing.
  - Hierarchy.

How this fits into the overall alignment

With previous and current changes combined:

- Mantine theme:
  - Aligned fonts and base feel to match the static design.
- Tokens.css:
  - Defines:
    - ui-btn, ui-card, ui-section primitives.
    - Hero-specific styles (eyebrow, hero-subtitle, hero-trust, booking / queue cards).
    - Grids and layouts for Why Us, How It Works, Seniors, Staff, CTA, and Contact.
- Index page and header:
  - Use those primitives consistently.
  - No conflicting button systems.

Result:

- The dynamic landing page now uses:
  - A single, coherent visual language.
  - Semantically structured sections identical to the PRD/PAD and static HTML trio.
  - A Mantine-powered layout that is visually indistinguishable in intent and hierarchy from the static mockups, without introducing a new UI stack.

This completes the requested step in the refinement plan for this iteration by:

- Removing the remaining inconsistent CTA styling.
- Ensuring all hero and navigation actions are rendered with the polished, design-system-backed components necessary to match the static mockup’s quality.
