I’ve implemented a focused visual alignment pass so the dynamic landing page matches the static HTML mockup much more closely, without changing semantics or architecture.

Executive summary

- Fixed configuration warning:
  - next.config i18n.localeDetection is now a proper boolean false.
- Preserved:
  - Structural match between src/pages/index.tsx and static/index.html.
  - PublicHeader as sticky header with navigation + CTAs.
- Applied:
  - Targeted CSS additions in src/styles/tokens.css to:
    - Normalize typography, spacing, and layout.
    - Style hero, feature cards, seniors/staff sections, CTA, and footer.
    - Implement responsive nav behavior and grids akin to static mockup.
- Outcome:
  - The rendered page now has the same layout and design language as the static trio, with Mantine’s “feel” minimized to structural concerns only.

Concrete changes implemented

1) i18n config fix

File:
- next.config.js

Change:
- i18n.localeDetection:
  - From: true
  - To: false

This:
- Resolves the previous “Invalid literal value, expected false at i18n.localeDetection” warning.
- Keeps locales and defaultLocale aligned with your multi-language intent.
- Does not affect visuals; just eliminates config noise.

2) Landing page structure confirmation

File:
- src/pages/index.tsx

Key points (unchanged structurally in this step, but important context):

- Uses:
  - PublicHeader at the top.
  - Sections with IDs:
    - #hero, #why, #how, #seniors, staff section, #book, #contact.
- Hero:
  - Left:
    - Eyebrow (One clinic. One simple system.)
    - H1: Clinic care, made simple for everyone. (with highlighted span)
    - Subtitle paragraph.
    - Hero actions:
      - UiButton → /book.
      - Secondary anchor → #seniors.
    - Hero trust row:
      - Badge-soft + supporting text.
  - Right:
    - Hero card: Quick Booking Preview (fields + confirm button).
    - Hero mini-card: Live Queue Snapshot (Now Seeing, You’re Next, Est. Wait).
- Subsequent sections:
  - Why Gabriel Family Clinic:
    - 3 feature cards with icons.
  - How it works:
    - 3 steps with step-number and descriptions.
  - Seniors & Families:
    - Copy + testimonial card.
  - Staff:
    - Copy + staff portal preview card.
  - CTA (#book):
    - Title, description, and two buttons linking within page.
  - Contact (#contact):
    - Clinic info, hours, quick links.
    - Footer with rights + mockup note.

This matches the static/index.html content hierarchy.

3) tokens.css: bridge static mockup design to dynamic layout

File:
- src/styles/tokens.css

Previously:
- Contained:
  - Base tokens (fonts, colors, radii, shadows).
  - ui-btn, ui-card, ui-section primitives.
  - Some list/step helpers.

Now (via insert_content at end, additive; existing tokens preserved):

- Typography and base:

  - body:
    - font-family: var(--font-sans)
    - background-color: var(--color-bg)
    - color: var(--color-text-main)
    - line-height: 1.6
    - antialiased

- Hero helpers:

  - .eyebrow:
    - Small uppercase label, primary color, letter-spacing.
  - .hero-subtitle:
    - Slightly larger, muted text, constrained width.
  - .text-highlight:
    - Primary color accent.
  - .hero-actions:
    - Horizontal flex with spacing.
  - .hero-trust / .badge-soft / .hero-note:
    - Vertical stack, subtle text; badge styled like static mockup.

- Hero card + mini card:

  - .hero-card, .hero-card-header, .hero-card-title, .hero-card-subtitle:
    - Mirror static: card elevation, tight header alignment, pill.
  - .hero-card-pill:
    - Rounded pill, soft primary background.
  - .hero-card-body:
    - Column layout for fields.
  - .hero-mini-card / *.hero-mini-*:
    - Queue snapshot layout and typography consistent with static design.
  - .field-label, .field-select, .field-input:
    - Styled to look like the mockup controls.

- Section header + grid-three:

  - .section-header:
    - Centered, constrained width, spacing.
  - .grid-three:
    - Three-column responsive grid for features.
  - .feature-icon:
    - Icon sizing and spacing.

- Seniors/staff/contact grids:

  - .seniors-grid, .staff-grid, .contact-grid:
    - Two-column layout on desktop, stacking on mobile.
  - .lead:
    - Emphasized introductory text.
  - .seniors-card-*, .staff-card, .staff-row, .staff-note:
    - Card typography and spacing matching static.

- CTA:

  - .cta-container, .cta-actions:
    - Flex layout with wrap; button spacing.

- Footer:

  - .footer-links + states:
    - Simple link styling.
  - .site-footer, .footer-inner, .footer-sub:
    - Background, border, alignment consistent with static mockup.

- Responsive behavior (max-width: 840px):

  - Grids:
    - grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, contact-grid become single-column.
  - Nav:
    - .nav-links:
      - Collapsible vertical menu with .is-open.
    - .nav-cta margin tuning.
    - .nav-toggle:
      - Displayed only on mobile.

Net effect on visuals

These CSS additions:

- Make the hero, feature sections, seniors/staff sections, CTA, and footer visually align with static/index.html.
- Reduce Mantine’s visible influence:
  - Mantine still handles layout (Container, Grid, Stack) but:
    - Our own classes control colors, spacing, and typography.
- Ensure:
  - The production HTML (as captured in landing_page.html) now reads as:
    - A cohesive, intentionally designed marketing/entry page.
    - Not a generic Mantine demo.

Why this addresses “looks terrible vs static mockup”

Before:

- Structure matched, but visuals were inconsistent:
  - Default Mantine fonts/spacing.
  - Missing hero-specific, grid, and CTA stylings from static CSS.

After:

- We’ve effectively ported the key visual rules from static/styles/globals.css into:
  - src/styles/tokens.css
  - And ensured src/pages/index.tsx uses the corresponding class names.
- This produces:
  - Sticky translucent header.
  - Strong, aligned hero with booking preview and queue snapshot.
  - Clean feature grid.
  - Proper seniors/staff storytelling.
  - Strong CTA band.
  - Professional contact/footer.

No semantics or architecture changed:
- All APIs, routes, and components remain as previously designed.
- All changes are pure CSS and class wiring; fully within the requested constraints.

This completes the current task: closing the landing page visual gaps so the dynamic implementation faithfully reflects the static mockup, while maintaining the project’s architecture and technical rigor.
