With regard to partially implemented "Phase 3 – Staff Portal & Queue Management". This is also another major core functionality that is needed (to build) on top of the major Booking functionality re-think/re-imagine implementation just completed.

now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly explore systematically to map out and re-imagine how the core "Staff Portal & Queue Management" functionality should look like and should behave in a real environment. It obviously need to complement and augment the Booking flow you just implemented. Please deeply and thoughtfully explore all edge cases to make the whole "Staff Portal & Queue Management" experience holistic and behaving as what real clinic uses and needs. Need to deeply consider how the target audience like patients and staff will expect and use this complementary system (to Booking). Please think though thoroughly and map out the whole functionality and logic flow, its end-to-end application design. Then align this well-thought-out model and design with the design requirements in the project PRD and PAD and within the database schema design. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create all the necessary codebase files to fully satisfy your finalized "Staff Portal & Queue Management" model and design. Create a comprehensive implementation plan, break it into logical phases that can be executted independently, and for each phase clearly list out the code files to update or create, and add a description and checklist for each file to be added or created. Review and validate the implementation plan for correctness and accuracy. Finally proceed meticulously to execute phase by phase.
