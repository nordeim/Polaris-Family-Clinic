awesome job so far! Please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to meticulously plan first before creating the following one by one in sequence:

1.  Generate exact API handler code for Phase 2 and Phase 3.  
2.  Provide example Jest and Playwright configs aligned with this plan.  
3.  All the database migrations and seed (code) files needed.
