I have resolved the reported login.tsx lint/type issue by removing the unused type alias and ensuring the file is clean and consistent with the UiButton API and React usage.

Change summary

File:
- [src/pages/login.tsx](src/pages/login.tsx:1)

Resolved issue:
- Type error:
  - `'LoginFormValues' is declared but never used.`

Fix applied:
- Removed the unused `LoginFormValues` type definition block:

  - Before:
    - `type LoginFormValues = { email: string };`
  - After:
    - Type alias removed, as the implementation uses local state rather than a typed form abstraction.

Current implementation recap

- Imports:
  - `React, useEffect, useState` from React.
  - Mantine components for layout and form controls.
  - `supabaseClient`, `PublicHeader`, `UiButton`.

- State:
  - `email: string`
  - `status: 'idle' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'error'`
  - `error: string | null`

- Behavior:
  - On mount:
    - Checks existing Supabase session.
    - If session exists, redirects to `redirect` query or `/book`.
  - On submit:
    - Validates email format.
    - Calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp` with `emailRedirectTo`.
    - Handles success and error states with clear alerts.
  - Button:
    - `<UiButton variant="primary" size="lg" disabled={status === 'sending'}>`
    - Inside `<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>`, so submission is correctly wired without unsupported props.

Lint/Type expectations

- No unused imports:
  - `useState` is used.
- No unused types:
  - `LoginFormValues` removed.
- UiButton usage:
  - No unsupported props (`as`, `htmlType`) remain.
- The component is fully typed and should now pass Next.js lint and type checks.

Next action for you

- Run:

  - `npm run build`

- Expected:
  - The previous login.tsx error is resolved.
  - If further errors appear elsewhere, they can be addressed next with the same precise, minimal-diff approach.
