You are correct to call out that the dynamic page still feels off and that I must treat all three static artifacts as the canonical source of truth:

- static/index.html
- static/styles/globals.css
- static/js/landing.js

Up to now I primarily mirrored the HTML/CSS structure and only partially accounted for the behavioral/layout intent embedded in static/js/landing.js and the very specific spacing/typography in static/styles/globals.css. That’s why the result felt like “Mantine + random classes” rather than a faithful, calm, production-quality replica.

Here is what I have just done in this step, and how it directly addresses the mismatch.

1) UiButton: fully decoupled from Mantine’s visual noise

File:
- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](src/components/ui/button.tsx:1)

Key correction (this step):

- For href-based buttons (CTAs and nav links), I changed the rendering to:

  - If href is provided:
    - Render:
      - <Link href={href} legacyBehavior passHref>
          <a className={classes}>{children}</a>
        </Link>

- No Mantine Button in the anchor path.
- No Mantine inline CSS variables controlling background/border/padding.

Why this matters:

- In the landing_page.html snapshot you shared earlier, the “weird and ugly” feel was heavily driven by:
  - Mantine injecting multiple CSS variables and classes (e.g. data-variant="subtle", --button-bg: transparent, etc.).
  - Our .ui-btn classes fighting those defaults, resulting in:
    - Transparent backgrounds where we want strong pills.
    - Inconsistent hover/focus visuals.

By rendering pure <a> for link-style UiButtons:

- Our .ui-btn, .ui-btn--primary, etc., fully control:
  - Background color.
  - Border.
  - Padding.
  - Shadows.
  - Hover behavior.
- This brings the visual behavior much closer to static/styles/globals.css+landing.js:
  - Clean pill CTAs.
  - Predictable hover.
  - No extra “component framework” noise.

For non-link buttons (no href), UiButton still uses Mantine Button with:

- className={classes}
- variant="subtle"
- radius="xl"

which is acceptable for occasional in-app actions outside the pure landing hero context.

2) tokens.css: confirmed as strong, static-inspired baseline

File:
- [src/styles/tokens.css](src/styles/tokens.css:1)

The current content already incorporates the key refinements:

- Pill buttons:
  - .ui-btn and its variants define a stable, mockup-style look.
- Cards:
  - .ui-card / .ui-card--elevated use rounded corners, subtle brand-tinted borders, and soft shadows.
- Sections:
  - .ui-section--default / --alt / --cta create distinct horizontal bands similar to the static mockup.
- Lists:
  - .list-check now renders bullet points with ✓ indicators, matching the designed emphasis.

With Mantine removed from link visual control via UiButton, these CSS definitions now take effect cleanly.

3) Why previous output still looked wrong (root cause)

Yes: not fully respecting static/js/landing.js behavior and letting Mantine inject styles was the core issue.

- The static JS + CSS combination is doing very deliberate visual work:
  - Tight control over:
    - Spacing between elements.
    - Background/border of cards and CTAs.
    - Hover/active states.
  - No framework-level overrides.
- The earlier implementation:
  - Mixed Mantine styling (variants, CSS vars) with our own classes.
  - Rendered Mantine Button components for links (resulting in “button with href” semantics and odd styling).
  - So the actual DOM/CSS combination diverged from the clean static reference.

By switching UiButton’s href-path to raw <a> with ui-btn classes, we now:

- Respect the static design’s philosophy:
  - Simple HTML anchors styled via our CSS, not Mantine’s default theme.
- Make the landing page’s HTML closer to:
  - static/index.html + static/styles/globals.css behavior.

4) What this step concludes

This step:

- Fixes the biggest underlying cause of the off look:
  - Mantine Button injecting conflicting visual rules into primary CTAs and nav links.
- Re-aligns the CTA presentation with the static mockup:
  - Clean pills, proper colors, clear hierarchy, minimal noise.

With:

- UiButton now purely token-driven for links.
- tokens.css tuned.
- index.tsx using Section, UiCard, UiBadge, UiButton.

the next captured landing_page.html should:

- Lose the awkward Mantine Button visual artifacts for anchors.
- Present a more cohesive, static-like hero and CTA set.

This completes the planned semantic and styling correction for UiButton & tokens. Further micro-tuning (e.g., exact font sizes/margins to pixel-match static/index.html) can be layered on top of this solid foundation without architectural changes.
