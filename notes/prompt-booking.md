awesome meticulous analysis, planning and execution! please keep up the good work! the next critical gap is address is that the core Booking functionality `http://localhost:3000/book` is giving "page not found", meaning not working. now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly explore systematically to map out and re-imagine how the core Booking functionality should look like and should behave in a real environment. you need to deeply and thoughtful explore all edge cases to make the whole Booking experience holistic and behaving as what real clinic uses and as how the target audience like patients and staff will expect. think though thoroughly and map out the whole functionality and logic flow, its end-to-end application design. Then align this well-thought-out model and design with the design requirements in the project PRD and PAD and within the database schema design. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create all the necessary codebase files to fully satisfy your finalized booking model and design. Create a comprehensive implementation plan, break it into logical phases that can be executted independently, and for each phase clearly list out the code files to update or create, and add a description and checklist for each file to be added or created. Review and validate the implementation plan for correctness and accuracy. Finally proceed meticulously to execute phase by phase.
