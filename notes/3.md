AGENT.md has been created as the consolidated single source-of-truth for AI coding agents working on this project.

It:

- Encapsulates:
  - The product vision, constraints, and senior-first philosophy.
  - The canonical architecture across frontend, backend, Supabase, and Twilio.
  - The authoritative database schema and RLS rules.
  - Core runtime utilities (`supabaseServer`, `supabaseClient`, `auth`, domain libs) and how to use them correctly.
  - The full intended page and API surface for patients, staff, and cron/notifications.
  - Frontend design system expectations aligned with the static landing mockup and Mantine-based UI primitives.
  - Testing and QA expectations (Jest, Playwright, manual scripts).
  - Operational and security rules (env vars, RLS usage, PDPA posture).
  - A precise checklist for how agents should safely handle future PRs.

- Is aligned with:
  - README
  - Project_Requirements_Document
  - Project_Architecture_Document
  - database_schema.sql
  - docs/project_review_and_codebase_understanding.md
  - docs/master_execution_todo_checklist.md
  - Phase implementation docs (phase0–5, phaseX-static-app, API_handler_code, jest_playwright_config)

- Provides:
  - Clear, prescriptive guidance so any future AI agent can:
    - Understand the system quickly.
    - Implement or review changes with minimal supervision.
    - Avoid security/RLS violations or architectural drift.
    - Keep the implementation boring, safe, and aligned with the clinic’s real-world needs.

This AGENT.md now serves as the operational manual and mental model anchor for all subsequent automated or human contributions to this repo.
