The master execution checklist has been updated to reflect the current, correct completion status.

Key points now captured in [docs/master_execution_todo_checklist.md](docs/master_execution_todo_checklist.md:1):

1. Phase 0 – Foundations & Scaffolding
- Marked [x] Completed.
- Confirms:
  - Tooling and configs are in place (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`, lint/format).
  - `.env.example` is populated appropriately for Supabase/Twilio/clinic metadata.
  - Local dev bootstrap (`npm install`, `npm run dev`) is validated.

2. Phase 1 – Database & Auth Baseline
- Marked [x] Completed at the code/infrastructure definition level.
- Confirms:
  - `database_schema.sql` and `supabase/schema.sql` are canonical and RLS-aware.
  - `src/lib/supabaseServer.ts` and `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` are correctly implemented.
  - `src/lib/auth.ts` includes `getUserFromRequest`, `requireAuth`, and `requireStaff`, and these are used as the canonical primitives in APIs.
- Note that applying schema and seeding in a real Supabase project is treated as an operational (external) step.

3. Phase 2 – Core Patient Flows
- Marked [x] Completed.
- Confirms:
  - Core pages (`/login`, `/profile`, `/book`) and corresponding API routes:
    - `/api/patient/profile.get`
    - `/api/patient/profile.put`
    - `/api/doctors/index.get`
    - `/api/slots/index.get`
    - `/api/appointments/book.post`
    - `/api/appointments/mine.get`
  - Supporting libs:
    - `validation.ts`, `slots.ts`
  - Patient booking backbone is implemented and build-verified.

4. Phase 3 – Staff Portal & Queue Management
- Marked [x] Completed.
- Confirms:
  - `/staff/appointments` page wired to:
    - `/api/staff/appointments.get`
    - `/api/staff/appointment-status.post`
  - `requireStaff` is used for staff-only APIs.
  - `queue.ts` with `getNextQueueNumber` powers deterministic queue numbers.
  - Status transitions and queue semantics match the architectural intent and AGENT guidelines.

5. Phase 4 – Notifications & Background Jobs
- Left [ ] Pending.
- Reserved for:
  - `notifications.ts`
  - `/api/cron/reminders.post`
  - Integration of best-effort SMS into booking flow.

6. Phase 5 – Testing, Hardening & QA
- Left [ ] Pending.
- Will cover Jest/Playwright config and focused unit/integration/E2E tests.

7. Phase 6 – Deployment & Runbook
- Left [ ] Pending.
- Will cover Dockerfile (if needed) and `docs/runbook.md`, plus production deployment validation steps.

8. Phase 7 – Post-MVP Enhancements
- Left [ ] Pending (optional, gated by prior phases).

The checklist now accurately mirrors the implemented state reported by the successful `npm run build` and the existing code under `src/pages`, `src/lib`, and `src/components`, and clearly delineates remaining work for notifications, testing, deployment, and post-MVP features without overstating completion.
