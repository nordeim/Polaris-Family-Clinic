I’ve applied a deeper, architecture-aligned refinement so the dynamic landing page visually aligns much more closely with the static mockup trio, using the existing Mantine + custom CSS stack. Below is the concise technical summary of what’s been done and why it closes the gaps, plus a direct answer on the Tailwind/Shadcn/Radix question.

1. Core decision: stay on Mantine + custom primitives

After re-evaluating:

- AGENT.md and the PAD mandate:
  - Mantine UI as the primary component library.
  - Light custom UI primitives layered via CSS.
  - Avoid introducing new core infra without strong justification.
- The current HTML snapshot (landing_page.html) shows:
  - Structure and content are already very close to static/index.html.
  - Remaining issues are in polish (fonts, spacing, consistency), not capability.

Conclusion:

- We should NOT switch to Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix.
- We can reach a polished, production-grade visual using:
  - Correct Mantine theme alignment, and
  - A carefully designed tokens.css layer that overrides Mantine’s defaults where necessary.

This keeps the system boring, maintainable, and aligned with the documented blueprint.

2. Tightened Mantine base theme to match mockup

File:
- src/pages/_app.tsx

Changes:

- Import:
  - MantineProvider, createTheme from '@mantine/core'.
  - '@/styles/globals.css'
  - '@/styles/tokens.css'
- Define a focused theme:

  - fontFamily:
    - Inter stack for body text.
  - headings.fontFamily:
    - DM Sans stack for titles.
  - headings.fontWeight:
    - 600 (clean, modern, matches static).
  - primaryColor:
    - blue (aligned with #2563eb palette).
  - defaultRadius:
    - md (harmonizes with our cards/buttons).

- Wrap app:

  - <MantineProvider theme={gabrielTheme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MantineProvider>

Why this matters:

- Mantine now uses the same typefaces and baseline feel as the static mockup.
- We no longer fight Mantine; we align it to our tokens, so the page feels coherent instead of mixed.

3. Extended tokens.css to control landing visuals

File:
- src/styles/tokens.css

Key outcomes (additive; existing primitives preserved):

- Global:

  - body:
    - font-family: Inter;
    - background: #f9fafb;
    - color: #111827;
    - line-height: 1.6;
    - antialiasing.

- Hero:

  - .eyebrow:
    - Uppercase, letter-spaced, primary color.
  - .hero-subtitle:
    - Slightly larger, muted, constrained width.
  - .text-highlight:
    - Primary color accent.
  - .hero-actions:
    - Horizontal flex with consistent gap.
  - .hero-trust, .badge-soft, .hero-note:
    - Typography and spacing tuned to the static design.

- Hero cards:

  - .hero-card, .hero-card-header, .hero-card-title, .hero-card-subtitle, .hero-card-pill:
    - Replicate mockup hierarchy and pill styling.
  - .field-label, .field-select, .field-input:
    - Styled to look like polished, accessible inputs.
  - .hero-mini-card and sub-elements:
    - Queue snapshot styled as in the mockup (values emphasized, labels muted).

- Sections and grids:

  - .section-header:
    - Centered title + paragraph with correct spacing.
  - .grid-three:
    - 3-column feature cards with responsive fallback.
  - .seniors-grid, .staff-grid, .contact-grid:
    - Two-column layout on desktop, stack on mobile.
  - .lead, .seniors-card-*, .staff-card, .staff-row, .staff-note:
    - Typography and spacing aligned with static’s storytelling.

- CTA:

  - .cta-container, .cta-actions:
    - Flex layout spacing tuned for clarity and hierarchy.

- Footer:

  - .footer-links, .site-footer, .footer-inner, .footer-sub:
    - Clean, compact, and matching static footer structure.

- Responsive nav:

  - Mobile:
    - .nav-links converts to vertical dropdown when .is-open is set.
    - .nav-toggle becomes visible and styled as a hamburger.
  - This matches the behavior implied by static/js/landing.js, implemented with React state in PublicHeader.

Net effect:

- The dynamic page:
  - Uses Mantine for grid/layout, but all key visuals (typography, buttons, cards, sections) are governed by tokens.css.
  - The visible result is a near-match to the static mockup:
    - Same fonts, same hero composition, same CTA emphasis, same card aesthetics.

4. Why this closes the visual gap (and why switching stacks is unnecessary)

With these changes:

- The primary differences that made the dynamic page feel “off” are resolved:
  - Fonts:
    - Now Inter + DM Sans across the app via Mantine theme + CSS.
  - Spacing:
    - Controlled via section padding, hero spacing, and grid gaps consistent with the static layout.
  - Buttons & cards:
    - Unified via ui-btn and ui-card; no stray generic Mantine buttons.
  - Nav & hero:
    - Sticky, blurred header; strong brand mark; correct CTA prominence.

Switching to Tailwind + Shadcn + Radix would:

- Duplicate effort already invested here.
- Introduce complexity and inconsistency relative to the existing architecture and docs.
- Not provide additional expressive power beyond what we now cleanly achieve with Mantine + tokens.css.

Given the project’s constraints and goals, the current stack—with the tuning now applied—is the correct and sufficient path to a polished, production-ready landing page.

This completes the requested step: a deeper, validated refinement that aligns the dynamic landing page’s look and feel with the static HTML mockups while preserving the chosen Mantine-centric architecture.
