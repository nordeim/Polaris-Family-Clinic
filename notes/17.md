I’ve fixed the reported build error and confirmed the root cause, while preserving the improved landing page implementation.

Issue reviewed

Latest error:

- File: src/pages/index.tsx
- Message:
  - 'Link' is declared but its value is never read.
- This arises during:
  - “Linting and checking validity of types” in next build.

Root cause:

- src/pages/index.tsx previously had:
  - import Link from 'next/link';
- After the recent refactor:
  - All navigation/CTA usage in HomePage uses:
    - PublicHeader (which itself uses plain anchors + UiButton).
    - Direct <a> links, UiButton with href, and Section IDs.
  - The Link import is no longer used anywhere in index.tsx.
- With strict lint/TS rules, unused imports are treated as errors in the Next.js build pipeline, causing the compilation to fail.

Fix applied

Change in:

- [src/pages/index.tsx](src/pages/index.tsx:1)

Before:

- import Link from 'next/link';
- import { Container, Stack, Group, Title, Text, Grid, Divider } from '@mantine/core';

After:

- import { Container, Stack, Group, Title, Text, Grid, Divider } from '@mantine/core';

Effect:

- The unused Link import is removed.
- The rest of the file remains intact and aligned with our designed layout.

Why this is correct

- HomePage now composes:
  - <PublicHeader />: handles top navigation and Book / Profile / Staff Portal entry.
  - <Section id="hero" ...>, <Section id="why" ...>, etc.:
    - Each section uses anchors / UiButtons consistent with the static mockup.
- No direct usage of next/link in index.tsx is needed:
  - In-page navigation uses native anchors (#hero/#why/#how/#seniors/#book/#contact).
  - Route-based navigation uses UiButton (which uses Next.js Link internally when href is set) or explicit anchors in PublicHeader.
- Removing the unused Link does not change behavior; it only resolves the lint/type error.

Current status

- The specific build blocker ('Link' unused in index.tsx) is resolved in code.
- Previously fixed:
  - Unused Link in PublicHeader.tsx was also removed.
- Landing page:
  - Structurally and semantically mirrors the static mockup:
    - Sticky header with nav + CTA.
    - Hero with split layout and booking/queue preview.
    - Why, How, Seniors, Staff, CTA, Contact sections.
  - Visuals driven by:
    - tokens.css UI primitives (ui-btn, ui-card, ui-section, etc.).
    - Existing Mantine layout components, without fighting their styles inappropriately.

Next (already identified, not yet changed here):

- Clean up non-fatal warnings:
  - Fix next.config i18n.localeDetection (set to false or remove).
  - Treat static/ as design-only; move any production assets to /public as needed.
  - Align output: 'standalone' usage with recommended start command for deployment.

With the unused import removed, the build should proceed past this lint/type check error, allowing you to validate the refined landing page visually in production build mode.
