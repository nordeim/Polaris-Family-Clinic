Summary

I have applied the next concrete set of changes to close visual gaps using the existing Mantine + custom primitives stack, focusing on:

- Eliminating residual inconsistent button styling.
- Ensuring the header CTAs and hero CTAs use the unified ui-btn design system.
- Preserving structural alignment with the static mockups.

Changes made in this iteration

1) Normalize hero CTAs in src/pages/index.tsx

- Replaced:
  - Confirm Booking button in the hero booking preview:
    - From:
      - className="btn btn-primary btn-full mt-2"
    - To:
      - className="ui-btn ui-btn--primary ui-btn--full mt-2"

- Replaced:
  - CTA in the CTA band:
    - From:
      - className="btn btn-primary btn-large"
    - To:
      - className="ui-btn ui-btn--primary ui-btn--lg"

Effect:

- All key CTAs on the landing page now use:
  - ui-btn ui-btn--primary ui-btn--lg or ui-btn--full
  - ui-btn ui-btn--outline ui-btn--lg for secondary actions.
- This ensures consistent pill-shaped buttons, shadows, and hover states, matching the static mockup visual language.

2) Normalize Book Now button in header

File:
- src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx

- Updated:
  - The nav “Book Now” button from legacy:
    - className="btn btn-primary btn-small nav-cta"
  - To:
    - className="ui-btn ui-btn--primary ui-btn--sm nav-cta"

Effect:

- Header CTA now visually aligns with:
  - The design-system buttons.
  - The static mockup’s pill blue “Book Now” in the top right.
- Removes the last divergent button style from the navigation.

3) Confirmed tokens.css is the single source of landing primitives

File:
- src/styles/tokens.css

Key confirmation points:

- ui-btn:
  - Centralized button primitive with primary/outline/ghost/subtle variants.
- ui-card, ui-card--elevated:
  - Rounded, shadowed cards reflecting the static design.
- Hero helpers:
  - eyebrow, hero-subtitle, hero-actions, hero-trust, badge-soft, hero-note.
  - hero-card, hero-mini-card and their sub-elements for booking and queue.
- Sections:
  - ui-section, ui-section--alt, ui-section--cta with consistent vertical spacing.
  - section-header, grid-three, seniors-grid, staff-grid, contact-grid.
- CTA:
  - cta-container, cta-actions.
- Footer:
  - footer-links, site-footer, footer-inner, footer-sub.
- Responsive:
  - Mobile nav behavior via nav-links + .is-open and nav-toggle.

This ensures:

- Mantine handles layout grids/containers.
- All visual identity (colors, fonts, radii, shadows, spacing) is driven by our tokens and ui-* classes, not ad hoc styles.

Why this materially closes gaps

Impact of the cumulative work:

1) Button system is coherent:
   - No leftover .btn classes on hero, CTA, or header CTAs.
   - Primary actions present as bold blue pills with proper hover/shadow.
   - Secondary actions align visually.

2) Card and section aesthetics:
   - Booking preview, queue snapshot, feature cards, seniors/staff cards all use ui-card and match the rounded, soft, elevated style of the static mockup.
   - Sections have consistent vertical rhythm via ui-section and section-header.

3) Typographic alignment:
   - Inter + DM Sans configured in Mantine theme (GabrielClinicApp in src/pages/_app.tsx).
   - Headings/paragraphs now read with the intended hierarchy.

4) Architecture compliance:
   - No introduction of Tailwind/Shadcn/Radix.
   - All changes respect AGENT.md:
     - Mantine + custom primitives.
     - Simple, maintainable, senior-friendly.

Responsiveness note

- The layout uses Mantine Grid with proper breakpoints:
  - Hero columns stack under 62em.
  - Sections (grid-three, seniors/staff/contact grids) are configured in tokens.css to stack under 840px.
- With the unified primitives, the mobile behavior is now predictable:
  - Cards stack elegantly.
  - CTAs remain tappable, pill-shaped, and large.

This iteration specifically removed the remaining inconsistent CTA/button styling and further aligned the key interactive elements with the static design system, which was a core source of the “less polished” perception. The stack remains Mantine + custom CSS, as required, and the implementation is now systematically consistent and production-ready for the landing page visuals.
